# Interactive Web Application – Final JavaScript Project

This project is an interactive web application developed as a **final project** for a JavaScript course in Coder House.  
It focuses on core **JavaScript fundamentals**, DOM manipulation, event handling, and form validation **without using frameworks**.

The goal of the project was to strengthen front-end logic and build a solid foundation before moving on to modern frameworks like React.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Dynamic DOM manipulation
- Event handling (clicks, submits, inputs)
- Client-side form validation
- Dynamic content rendering
- Clean and structured JavaScript logic
- Simple and user-friendly interface

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **JavaScript (ES6+)** – application logic and DOM interaction
- **HTML5** – semantic structure
- **CSS3** – styling and layout
- **Git & GitHub** – version control

---

## 📚 What This Project Demonstrates

- Strong understanding of **Vanilla JavaScript**
- Ability to build interactive features without external libraries
- Proper handling of DOM events and updates
- Logical problem-solving and code organization
- Solid front-end foundations for scaling into frameworks like React
